# hmm_ner_tagger
A Name Entity Recogonition (NER) Tagger based on a Hidden Markov Model. The parameters are estimated using supervised training. An improved NER tagger is based on linear model using 64 features.

hw2_main.py: the main script, generates the requires files dev-i, test-i and weight_trained

hw2_functions.py: define functions that will be used in hw2_main

notice that you may need to change the path when implementing my code.

IMPORTANT NOTE: THESE CODES ARE NOT DIRECTLY USABLE BECAUSE THE TRAINING, DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING SAMPLES AND THE WEIGHTS FILE FOR THE LINEAR FEATURE TAGGER ARE NOT PROVIDED (BECAUSE I HAVE NOT GOT THE PERMISSION YET). IF YOU NEED IT, YOU CAN CONTANT ME.
